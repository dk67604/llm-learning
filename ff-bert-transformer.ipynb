    "### Flash Attention is an efficient attention mechanism designed to speed up and reduce memory usage in transformer models like BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "It computes attention in a way that avoids storing large intermediate matrices, making it suitable for long sequences and large models. In a Flash Attention-based BERT, the standard attention mechanism in BERT is replaced with Flash Attention. This allows for faster training and inference, especially on modern GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key points:\n",
    "- Flash Attention uses tiling and recomputation to reduce memory usage.\n",
    "- It enables training with longer sequences or larger batch sizes.\n",
    "- Integrating Flash Attention into BERT can be done by replacing the attention modules in the BERT architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example resources:\n",
    "- [Flash Attention paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)\n",
    "- [Official implementation](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Flash Attention in BERT, you can use libraries like Hugging Face Transformers with Flash Attention support, or integrate the official Flash Attention implementation into your custom BERT model."
